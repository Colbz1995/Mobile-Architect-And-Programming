- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  - The goal of this app is to allow the user to keep track of events. The app will let the user add events, modify events, and delete events. 
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  - Screens that were necessary for this app includes: login screen, event display screen, add event screen, and a modify event screen. In order to keep the user's privacy, I had to add a login screen for the user to login. Their login information is kept in a database along with their events that they add. The event display screen will display the events in a table format so it is readable. To make it obvious, there is a floating action button at the bottom right corner of the screen to let the user know that if pressed, they will be able to add a new event. Also, in each row, there is a trash can icon to the right of each row indicating the user to delete that event. With the use of icons in this app, I makes it easier for the user to learn how to use the app.
  
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  - Knowing the requirements and user needs for this app helped me in developing the app. Also, looking a other event tracking apps helps me get a good idea on how they would operate and how they should look and appeal to the users.  

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  - For testing, all I did was run the program and use an emulator to test if everything was working the way it should. I think this type of testing is important because it will give me information on how well the app is working, and for helping me find any bugs in the code. Sometimes, I had to use the debugger tool in Android Studio to figure out what a certain part of the code was not working.   


- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  -  One thing that I changed was the use of fragments and using Androids navigation components. I think solution would have been even more time consuming and would making the code more complex, so I decided to just use activities to make my life a whole lot easier. 

- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  - I think one component from the app that shows my knowledge, skiils, and experience would have to be the use of Intents. My app uses 3 activities and each activity transitions to another activity. For exmaple, the login screen transfers to the event display activity. Intents allows me to transfer from one activity to another. Besides transfering to another activity, I can also send data to an activity as well as send data back to the activity that transfered to that activity.
